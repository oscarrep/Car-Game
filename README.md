## How to play

In Synthcar you target to fall with your car into a square target formed by 5 horizontal lines. Each line has a different color, and each gives a certain amount of points:

  * Red Line: 3 points
  * Blue Line: 2 points
  * Green Line: 1 point
  * Yellow Line: 2 points
  * Black Line: 3 Points
  
  The lines value is defined by how hard it is to land on them. Green is the easiest, in most cases at good speed you'll fall there. Blue and Green are quite easy as well but need slightly reduced or inclreased speed compared to a jump for Green. Red and Black are the hardest, being in the edges of the target. Red requires the minimal speed to get to the target, but enough not to hit the ground. Black requires maximum speed to fall on the target, but not enough to fly by it. Furthermore, hitting the ground substracts one point and ends the player's turn.
